     <li>Authors are requested to submit the abstract (250-300 words) and biography(80-100 words) and your photograph that shows your clear face in 250*250 size.</li>
     <li>Selected abstract submissions will be presented during oral sessions generally lasting for 3-4 hours. Authors will present their research/overview, etc. in a specific topic area, and presentations will be moderated by experts in the field.</li>

     <h2 className='headspeakerguidelines'>Presentation Length</h2>
     <li>Oral presenters will be allocated 25 minutes for their presentation and 5 minutes for questions and answers. If the presentation exceeds 25 minutes, the moderator will shorten the Q&A period that follows the presentation.</li>
     <li>Our experience indicates that up to 20 slides is optimal, allowing 1 minute per slide. You may choose to use more than 20 slides, but please be sure to complete your presentation within the allocated 25 minutes.
